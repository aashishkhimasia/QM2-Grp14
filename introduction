Introduction 

Motivation 

As a group of five students at University College London, we have found that we all have a common interest in wellbeing - more specifically, the wellbeing of wild 
animals. As interdisciplinary students we are intrigued by how gaining an understanding of the unique experiences of animals requires drawing upon many different 
fields, like ethics, philosophy, and science, and are curious about how we can think across these disciplines, in order to call attention to the animal species which 
require intervention. 

By analyzing the mission statements and policies of the top wildlife organizations in the world - World Animal Protection, the Animal Welfare Institute, Defenders 
of Wildlife, Save the Elephants, the United Nations Development Programme, Wildlife Conservation Society, Wildlife Alliance, World Bank, World Wildlife Fund, the 
World Animal Initiative, as well as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), we were curious to see what their 
main focal point was. By using NLP we created a histogram to visualize the most frequent 30 nouns used in their statements. We noticed that while words such as 
“trade,” “accordance,” and “conservation,” are among the most used ones, the word “welfare” is used only 7 times across all these organizations’ statements, 
suggesting that this aspect is not a predominant focus for these organizations. This prompted our curiosity on the domain of wild animal welfare, one that is not 
very studied, and led us to direct our project towards the following research questions: 
What is the quality of life of these wildlife animals?
Which wild animal species should human interventions be focused upon? (written by Lucia & Sorana) 


According to the American Veterinary Medical Association (2020), animal welfare refers to "how an animal is coping with the conditions in which it lives. 
An animal is in a good state of welfare if (as indicated by scientific evidence) it is healthy, comfortable, well-nourished, safe, able to express innate behavior, and if it is not suffering from unpleasant states such as pain, fear, and distress."

Why does it matter? 
Because it has a huge scale: Wild land vertebrates number between 10^11 and 10^14. Wild marine vertebrates number at least 10^13. Terrestrial and marine arthropods each probably number at least 10^18 
It is a very neglected subject: Only 2 organisations in the world with central focus upon reducing wild animal suffering (Wild Animal Initiative & The Neuroethics Foundation), with a total funding of 200,000 USD (2018).
And it is not very tractable, little research has been done on wild animal welfare, therefore a lot of groundwork to be done that will further the cause.
Thus making it a moral pressing issue.
