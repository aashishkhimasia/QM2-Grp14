Introduction 

Motivation 

As a group of five students at University College London, we have found that we all have a common interest in wellbeing - more specifically, the wellbeing of wild 
animals. As interdisciplinary students we are intrigued by how gaining an understanding of the unique experiences of animals requires drawing upon many different 
fields, like ethics, philosophy, and science, and are curious about how we can think across these disciplines, in order to call attention to the animal species which 
require intervention. 

According to the American Veterinary Medical Association (2020), animal welfare refers to "how an animal is coping with the conditions in which it lives. 
An animal is in a good state of welfare if (as indicated by scientific evidence) it is healthy, comfortable, well-nourished, safe, able to express innate behavior, and if it is not suffering from unpleasant states such as pain, fear, and distress."

Why does it matter? 
Because it has a huge scale: Wild land vertebrates number between 10^11 and 10^14. Wild marine vertebrates number at least 10^13. Terrestrial and marine arthropods each probably number at least 10^18 
It is a very neglected subject: Only 2 organisations in the world with central focus upon reducing wild animal suffering (Wild Animal Initiative & The Neuroethics Foundation), with a total funding of 200,000 USD (2018).
And it is not very tractable, little research has been done on wild animal welfare, therefore a lot of groundwork to be done that will further the cause.
Thus making it a moral pressing issue.
