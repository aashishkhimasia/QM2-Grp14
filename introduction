Introduction 

According to the American Veterinary Medical Association (2020), "Animal welfare is how an animal is coping with the conditions in which it lives. 
An animal is in a good state of welfare if (as indicated by scientific evidence) it is healthy, comfortable, well-nourished, safe, able to express innate behavior, and if it is not suffering from unpleasant states such as pain, fear, and distress."

Why does it matter? 
Because it has a huge scale: Wild land vertebrates number between 10^11 and 10^14. Wild marine vertebrates number at least 10^13. Terrestrial and marine arthropods each probably number at least 10^18 
It is a very neglected subject: Only 2 organisations in the world with central focus upon this (Wild Animal Initiative & Aniaml Ethics), with a total funding of 200,000 USD (2018).
And it is not very tractable, with a lot of groundwork to be done that will further the cause.
Thus making it a moral pressing issue.

Key Uncertainties within the field 
This field presents many uncertainties, from which we will be focusing on the ones in bold:
What is the welfare level of different wild animal species?
How can we accurately estimate the welfare of a wild animal?
Which species should we be focusing resources and attention upon? 
How can we intervene to improve wild animal welfare? 
How do estimates of animal welfare vary from different philosphical frameworks?
Is it a morally correct to be intervening to imporve welfare in wild animal opulations?
