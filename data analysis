data analysis in website 

basic linear form: y=\sum(w_i x_i)

compression function: 

1)logistic form :compressed to the range (0,1) 
 
 welfare= e^{y}/1+e^{y}
 
2)max-min compression:compressed to the range (0,1)

 welfare= (y-min{y})/(max{y}-min{y})
 
3)probit form:compressed to the range (0,1)
 
 welfare= probit(y-mean{y}/sigma{y})
 
 4)tanh formï¼šcompressed to range (-1,1)
 when the welfare is negative, we can really show the disadvantaged situations.
 
 welfare= (e^{y}-e^{-y})/(e^{y}+e^{-y})
 
 To standarize each variable:
 
 max-min standarization is suggested:
 x~(x-min{x})/(max{x}-min{x}) 
 
 if applying clustering, the standarized variable may be even more helpful


Comparing work: 

Regress the welfare index  on some other variables (maybe geographical varibles/country dummy) to analyse what realy influence the wellfare, and make the comparision.

welfare index = a_0 + b_1 * geographical variable vectors + country dummy variable + other varibles
