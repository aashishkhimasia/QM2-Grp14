Our Project Outline

Timeline

Step by Step:
Function and Data Analysis:
Decide which species to use and ensure we have the correct data for each one
Formalise the function
Apply the function to the species we want to use
Create box-whisker plot of the output grouped by order/class
Search animal welfare journals for papers on each species
Perform a linear regression between number of papers and function output

Interactive Map
Cluster the outputs of the function geographically and visualise 
Create interactive map showing the animal welfare in each region
Create case study 
Create cartogram (size = legislations about wild animal welfare)

Natural Langauge Processing:
Find summative policy statements by the world's leading wildlife organisations to use for NLP
Visualise the findings (word cloud)
Use the conclusions from this analysis to explain why we are doing this project in the introduction

Conclusions:
Analysis and findings
Limitations
Call to action - what data is needed to progress and what we would do with it
