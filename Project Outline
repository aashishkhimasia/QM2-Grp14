Our Project Outline

Timeline

Step by Step:

Natural Langauge Processing:
Find summative policy statements by the world's leading wildlife organisations to use for NLP - by Sunday 20th
Visualise the findings (word cloud)- by Monday 21st
Use the conclusions from this analysis to explain why we are doing this project in the introduction- by Monday 21st 

Function and Data Analysis:
Decide which species to use and ensure we have the correct data for each one - by Sunday 20th
Formalise the function - by Monday 21st
Apply the function to the species we want to use - by Monday 21st
Create box-whisker plot of the output grouped by order/class - by Friday 25th th
Search animal welfare journals for papers on each species - by Monday 21st
Perform a linear regression between number of papers and function output - by Friday 25th

Interactive Map
Cluster the outputs of the function geographically and visualise - by Friday 1st
Create interactive map showing the animal welfare in each region - by Friday 1st
Create case study - by Monday 4th
Create cartogram (size = legislations about wild animal welfare)- by Monday 4th

Conclusions:
Analysis and findings - by Friday 8th
Limitations - by Friday 8th
Call to action - what data is needed to progress and what we would do with it - by Friday 8th
