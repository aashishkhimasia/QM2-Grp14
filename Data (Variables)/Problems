1.Lack of raw data: IMR(Infant Mortality Rate) and RP(Reproduction Rate) missing.
2.Some of the species selected by Aashihsh were not found in the raw data: both Mortality rate and Ways of dying (especially WoD cuz most 
  of the species were not found)
  Mammals: Pan troglodytes subsp schweinfurthii
           Panthera pardus
  Reptiles: Chrysemys picta
            Crocodylus johnsoni
            Cryptophis nigrescens
            Hoplocephalus bungaroides
            Kinosternon subrubrum
 3.There are more than one sample group of the same species given in the raw data. --> Average was taken.
 4. There are 6 species found without reproduction rate so I am not able to calculate the welfare using our function.
 So I prefer to remove them from our data if there is no other ways to obtain the data, given that the decreasing sample size will not affect the unbiasness.  
 5. It is found that the reproduction rate of the species of amphibians are significantly higher than the other spcies as (Amphibians :500-3000, Others:(0.001-50).
 So the adjusted scores on RR given to the amphibians are much higher as well, the average score given to the mammals is no more than 1 while the amphibians' score
 are bove 80. So how do you guys think about it? Would you maintain the scores or maybe you want t make further adjustments to the scores to narrow down the gap 
 (so the amphibians will not take too much adventages on RR as it is accompanies with larger number of infant mortality).

Solutions
1. True Leslie Matrices containing data which can be interpreted to find IMR amd RP has been shared through google drive
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19Qdc2egaR4e95hlu8tfN1yCr-LKUWq4y?usp=sharing
2. "Our animal species - life expectancy, max lifespan" file has been shared on github and contains this data 
3. This works for our analysis by species which isn't related to location, but when we perform location based analyses we will need to separate these samples.
