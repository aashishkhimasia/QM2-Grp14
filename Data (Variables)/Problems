1.Lack of raw data: IMR(Infant Mortality Rate) and RP(Reproduction Rate) missing.
2.Some of the species selected by Aashihsh were not found in the raw data: both Mortality rate and Ways of dying (especially WoD cuz most 
  of the species were not found)
  Mammals: Pan troglodytes subsp schweinfurthii
           Panthera pardus
  Reptiles: Chrysemys picta
            Crocodylus johnsoni
            Cryptophis nigrescens
            Hoplocephalus bungaroides
            Kinosternon subrubrum
 3.There are more than one sample group of the same species given in the raw data. --> Average was taken.

Solutions
1. True Leslie Matrices containing data which can be interpreted to find IMR amd RP has been shared through google drive
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19Qdc2egaR4e95hlu8tfN1yCr-LKUWq4y?usp=sharing
2. Our animal species - life expectancy, max lifespan has been shared on github and contains this data 
3. This works for our analysis by species which isn't related to location, but when we perform location based analyses we will need to separate these samples.
