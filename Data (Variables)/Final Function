The final expression of the animal welfare in our project is in the form of a linear function of mutiple variables

       OW = 0.25 RR + 0.75 (0.45 RWE + 0.55 LS)  
          = 0.25 RR + 0.75 (0.45 RWE + 0.55 (0.8 LE/ML - 0.2 IMR) )
           
          where OW - Overall Welfare
                RR - Reproduction Rate            
                REW - Relative Welfare Expectancy
                LS - Life Span
                LE/ML - Life Expectancy/Maximum Life Span
                IMR - Infant Mortality Rate
                
 PS: 1. As the term TYPES OF DEATH is deleted from the function, the coefficient given to the other tow variables were changed :
        Life Span changes from 0.45 to 0.75 and Reproduction Rate changes from 0.15 to 0.25. This it to keep the sum of coefficient to 1
        while remainining the linear relationship between the variables. ( LS = 3 * RR)
     2. The final result of the overall werlfare is adjusted to 0-100 scale for the sake of the comprehension and further analysis. The step 
        is completed by adding 8.25 to the initial output of each species. This is due to the fact that there is a negative term (IMR) in the 
        function, making the scale shift away from the 0-100 scale. (MAX = 91.75, MIN = -8.25 ) Since the MAX and MIN are 8.25 lower than the 
        expected value, a parallel upward shift is made by adding 8.25 to each output.
