Literature Review

Research Questions
- Review existing models from different disciplines to find which type of model we should use (linear, non linear etc)
- How do we consider the impact of different variables to welfare qualitatively? 
  - What moral framework are we evaluating this with?
- What methods of data analysis and visualisation could we use?

This article reviews various welfare indicators, assessment methods and scientific approaches towards assessing animal welfare.
There is no established method for assessing animal welfare; however various frameworks have been put forth. 
Generally three approaches are followed in assessing animal welfare: (1) naturalistic, (2) functional and (3) subjective.
There are various types of indicators which directly reflect the welfare status of an animal. 
In broader terms, welfare indicators can be grouped under four categories: (1) behavioral, (2) physical, (3) physiological and (4) production oriented.
