Literature Review

Research Questions
- Review existing models from different disciplines to find which type of model we should use (linear, non linear etc)
- How do we consider the impact of different variables to welfare qualitatively? 
  - What moral framework are we evaluating this with?
- What methods of data analysis and visualisation could we use?

This article reviews various welfare indicators, assessment methods and scientific approaches towards assessing animal welfare.
There is no established method for assessing animal welfare; however various frameworks have been put forth. 
Generally three approaches are followed in assessing animal welfare: (1) naturalistic, (2) functional and (3) subjective.
There are various types of indicators which directly reflect the welfare status of an animal. 
In broader terms, welfare indicators can be grouped under four categories: (1) behavioral, (2) physical, (3) physiological and (4) production oriented.

Preliminary Framework Research
Utilitarianism
A theory of consequences. The consequences of an action are the only type of right or wrong. A being's state is determined by a balance of the pain and pleasure they experience, with the broad aim being to maximise pleasure and minimize the pain. 
How do we judge actions?
Act Utilitarianism 
- We must consider what the likely consequences are of an action in a particular situation and judge it's utility based upon that
Rule Utiliarianism 
- Base it on potential rules of action to determine whether the general rule means the action would increase or decrease happiness. There can be exceptions to the rule.
—> Rule utilitarianism may apply better, as we don't know the case by case situations for each piece of data we have, so we should generate rules to judge them by
Is there symmetry between the positive and negative experiences?
Negative Utilitarianism
- There is not symmetry been suffering and happiness. Suffering has a direct, pressing appeal for help and the end of that suffering, whereas there is no similar internal call to increase happiness.
- Pain cannot be outweighed by pleasure
—> This is quite extreme, however we should consider further research to animal psychology to work out
1. How pleasurable and painful events persist in their experience in the short term and long term
2. How animals tend to relate pain and pleasure to each other 
How do we aggreggate the experiences?
Prioriantarianism
- The extent of "goodness" of an outcome can be taken s a function of the overall wellbeing across all animals, with extra weight given to the experience of the worse-off animals
- The weight of all individuals are not aggregated equally, but those that suffer more within a population are worse off
Total Utiliarianism 
- The target utility is found to be the maximum utility that there is across the population, by adding all the utilities of each individual together
Average Utilitarianism 
- Values the average utility amongst the group members and so aims to maximise this
—> This is very important, as we expect a high rate of infant mortality and we must consider how this will skew the overall welfare value we attribute
How do we consider the value of time and lifespan?
Declining Marginal Utility 
- The utility of the same thing is less to a more well off individual to a worse off one. Someone who has lived alonger life will gain less utility for being anle to live one more
Do we consider future experiences to have moral significance?
- Does this depend upon whether there will be a predominantly positive future?
Potential Methods of relating qualitative experiences to quantitative measures
Relative Time
- Calculate the proportion of an animal's life spent dying
    - This can give an idea of the extent of that suffering

More Framework Research
Why utilitarianism?
- A moral theory that allows us to evaluate and weigh up variables
    —> Makes it possible to actually do this kind of project quantitatively 
- Theory of consequences, cannot know a lot of things about animals states of mind, especially values therefore a virtue based system would be harder to implement
What branch of utilitarianism?
Weak Negative Utilitarianism 
- Suffering and happiness both count, but suffering counts more. There is an exchange rate between suffering and happiness or perhaps some nonlinear function which shows how much happiness would be required to outweigh any given amount of suffering. (Toby Ord)
- [http://www.amirrorclear.net/academic/ideas/negative-utilitarianism/](http://www.amirrorclear.net/academic/ideas/negative-utilitarianism/)
    —> This will impact our coefficients, when considering how much the positive and negative experiences should contribute to the overall variable (negative has more weighting)
Why negative utilitarianism?
Animals display risk aversive decision making processing
- Risk aversion is generated by natural selection (McAfee, 1984)
- Neurophysiological evidence suggest that an aversion to loses could have it's root in evolutionary ancient brain circuits
[https://ir.lib.uwo.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1796&context=economicsresrpt](https://ir.lib.uwo.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1796&context=economicsresrpt)
- When faced with the choice between uncertain and certain outcomes, they choose certainty
https://www.jstor.org/stable/1821343?casa_token=qd4EXodbDtAAAAAA%3AAkpPCpsSEt_1IN6M8QgSs_JYUWXsG8WKthO4ifETHd7sQkP190uI2CRSflZiMnuW68Y0PPT0kzIncFtB2T1-VRE9ask57EQnG4M4nz0ZZMlZ3NXiAZg&seq=15#metadata_info_tab_contents
--> Appears very inherent to animals that risks are weighted more than rewards and this implies that suffering is worse than pleasure is good

Animal Sentience 
- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4494450/#:~:text=Animal%20sentience%20refers%20to%20the,2%2C3%2C4%5
- https://www.livescience.com/39481-time-to-declare-animal-sentience.html

-> animal sentience 
	-> animal sentience is fundamental to many disciplines and imperative to the animal welfare movement
	-> it refers to the ability of animals to feel and experience emotions such as joy, pleasure, pain and fear. 
	-> their capacity to feel both positive and negative states that drives the animal welfare movement and is the reason why animal protection laws exist 


Key factors for death 


- Severity of suffering involved
    - Awareness of the experience (https://www.eiu.edu/humanitiescenter/pdf/The%20Dying%20Animal.pdf) 
    
    -> new research challenges the fact that only humans have an awareness of death 
    -> death-related behavior in primates: 
	      -> a study conducted by three researchers at the University of Stirling shows that animals’ responses to death are strikingly similar to humans’ responses. (study conducted on chimpanzees)
    -> death-related behavior in non-primates: 
	      -> zoologist Iain Douglas-Hamilton believes that elephants have a general awareness + curiosity about death ( “they will gather around the body of a dead 
        herd member, gently touching the body with their trunks and feet, often standing vigil for days.” - Cynthia Moss)

    - Fear involved (have they seen other organisms die in this way) -> psychological distress
   
   -> animals experience natural death and violent death inflicted upon them differently (violent death caused by humans - worse than natural death)
   -> study suggests that witnessing the killing of offspring,  companions, or conspecifics can be profoundly distressing for animals (e.g. studies conducted on 
   rats show increased heart rate and blood pressure (stress responses) when watching other animals being decapitated, same response was documented in mice and monkeys) 
   -> highly sensitive animals, such as elephants, suffer from PTSD after witnessing family members of herd-mates being slaughtered by poachers.

    
    - Physical suffering
    
    -> it is important to identify the causes of death that entail more suffering than others (https://www.wildanimalinitiative.org/blog/cause-of-death-2) 
    -> loss of the individual + disruption of fertility & reproductive success (e.g. the fetus of a pregnant female that is malnourished may die)

- Time
    - Duration (objective)
    - Relative time (subjective)

    —> Depends upon how animals perceive time. Probably more relative but need to update this. Perhaps could combine both 
    -> research suggests that at least some animal species have “chronesthesia”(the ability to be aware) -> impacts welfare:  ethicists have argued think 
    that if animals are stuck in the present, "then when they experience pain, they are their pain. Their entire world is pain, without the mitigating knowledge that sometime in the future the 
    pain may end” - Bernie Rollin)
    Evidence of the relationship between pain and psychological time
    	- Several studies have shown that pain significantly lengthened the subjective duration of a stimulus 
		- As pain intensity increases, negative distortion of time increases (longer)
		- Anxiety compounds this effect 
	--> The more painful the death is, the longer it will feel
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-15982-6

- Variables - types of death: (harvest, vehicle accidents, drowning, predation, fence entanglement, poisoning, starvation, disease)

Estimated duration for each type of death: 
-> harvest: minutes
-> vehicle accidents: minutes-hours 
-> drowning: <60 seconds
-> predation: minutes
-> fence entanglement: days
-> poisoning: minutes-hours
-> starvation: 40-60 days
-> disease: varies, but can be longer than other types of death, depending on the disease

---> from “best” to worst (according to studies showing that violent, human caused death is worse than natural death + estimated durations): 
drowning, predation, fence entanglement, starvation, disease, harvest, poisoning, vehicle accidents



Life Span Variable 
Subvariables
   - Relative welfare expectancy 
   	- If RWE > 1, Most individuals will survive to a point of experiencing a period of above-average welfare
	- If RWE < 1, Most individuals won't survive to a point of experiencing a period of above-average welfare
   - Life Expectancy/Max Life Span
   	- Life Expectancy/Maximum life Span x 100 --> gives percentage of maximum life live on average
   - Infant Mortality Rate
   	- 1-survival rate from first year of life
How to process these
   - RWE gives a more objective idea of whether an experience is positive or negative, so the feature of being normalised around 1 is important. We could add for RWE > 1 and subtract for RWE < 1. However, then we need a baseline from the other factors and the other ones are relative so this wouldn't work. Therefore, we should make it proportionate
   - LE/ML - set it so that 100% of the marks for this subvariable is awarded to the species with the highest LE/ML out of all the data we have, and 0% is awarded to the one with the lowest. Then, the marks between 0% and 100% will be awarded proportionate to where they fall in the range
   	--> Makes data comparative, removes the burden of having to define an absolute value for what would count as positive and negative
   - IMR - similar to LE/ML
How to combine these
   - Total score of 100 available from all subvariables combined
   	- RWE is very important at grounding the overall valence
	- IMR And LE/ML are related and can combine to increase or decrease the initial value of RWE 
		- RWE = 45%
		- X = 55% 
		   - LE/ML = 80% of x, IMR = 20% of x
		- 0.45(RWE) + 0.55(0.8(LE/ML) + 0.2(IMR)) = L
		

Legislation 

welfare and international law -> 
https://www.globalpolicyjournal.com/articles/international-law-and-human-rights/wild-animal-welfare-international-law-present-position-a


FOR INTERACTIVE MAP & CASE STUDY 
https://api.worldanimalprotection.org/methodology

The Animal Protection Index  (API) is assessed according to 10 indicators and grouped in 4 goals 
- 4 goals: 
	1) recognition of animal sentience and prohibition of animal suffereing 
	2) PRESENCE OF ANIMAL WELFARE LEGISLATION -> which we will be focusing on
	   https://api.worldanimalprotection.org/indicators#Legislation
		a) laws that apply to animals in captivity 
		b) laws that apply for animals used for draught and recreation 
		c) laws that apply the animals used in scientific research 
		d) laws that apply to wild animals -> which we will be focusing on 
			https://api.worldanimalprotection.org/indicators#Legislation
			- countries are ranked from A (ligh bright green) to G (dark red)
			- A countries  score ‘A’ for this indicator because its legislation contains:
				- Ban on sport and recreational hunting.
				- Wildlife management uses hunting only as a last resort, after demonstrating that all other alternatives have failed.
				- The cruellest forms of hunting are banned (i.e. dog hunting, live baiting, poisoning, trapping, falconry, bow hunting).
		worse country is Ukraine, and best is Kenya 
	3) establishment of supportive governmemt bodies 
	4) support for international animal wefare satandards
