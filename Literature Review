Literature Review

Research Questions
- Review existing models from different disciplines to find which type of model we should use (linear, non linear etc)
- How do we consider the impact of different variables to welfare qualitatively? 
  - What moral framework are we evaluating this with?
- What methods of data analysis and visualisation could we use?

This article reviews various welfare indicators, assessment methods and scientific approaches towards assessing animal welfare.
There is no established method for assessing animal welfare; however various frameworks have been put forth. 
Generally three approaches are followed in assessing animal welfare: (1) naturalistic, (2) functional and (3) subjective.
There are various types of indicators which directly reflect the welfare status of an animal. 
In broader terms, welfare indicators can be grouped under four categories: (1) behavioral, (2) physical, (3) physiological and (4) production oriented.

The moral theory we choose to ground our project in will determine how we evaluate each experience and relate it to the overall welfare of the animal.

Utilitarianism

A theory of consequences. The consequences of an action are the only type of right or wrong. A being's state is determined by a balance of the pain and pleasure they experience, with the broad aim being to maximise pleasure and minimize the pain. 

How do we judge actions?

Act Utilitarianism 

- We must consider what the likely consequences are of an action in a particular situation and judge it's utility based upon that

Rule Utiliarianism 

- Base it on potential rules of action to determine whether the general rule means the action would increase or decrease happiness. There can be exceptions to the rule.

—> Rule utilitarianism may apply better, as we don't know the case by case situations for each piece of data we have, so we should generate rules to judge them by

Is there symmetry between the positive and negative experiences?

Negative Utilitarianism

- There is not symmetry been suffering and happiness. Suffering has a direct, pressing appeal for help and the end of that suffering, whereas there is no similar internal call to increase happiness.
- Pain cannot be outweighed by pleasure

—> This is quite extreme, however we should consider further research to animal psychology to work out

1. How pleasurable and painful events persist in their experience in the short term and long term
2. How animals tend to relate pain and pleasure to each other 

How do we aggreggate the experiences?

Prioriantarianism

- The extent of "goodness" of an outcome can be taken s a function of the overall wellbeing across all animals, with extra weight given to the experience of the worse-off animals
- The weight of all individuals are not aggregated equally, but those that suffer more within a population are worse off

Total Utiliarianism 

- The target utility is found to be the maximum utility that there is across the population, by adding all the utilities of each individual together

Average Utilitarianism 

- Values the average utility amongst the group members and so aims to maximise this

—> This is very important, as we expect a high rate of infant mortality and we must consider how this will skew the overall welfare value we attribute

How do we consider the value of time and lifespan?

Declining Marginal Utility 

- The utility of the same thing is less to a more well off individual to a worse off one. Someone who has lived alonger life will gain less utility for being anle to live one more

Do we consider future experiences to have moral significance?

- Does this depend upon whether there will be a predominantly positive future?

Potential Methods of relating qualitative experiences to quantitative measures

Relative Time

- Calculate the proportion of an animal's life spent dying
    - This can give an idea of the extent of that suffering

Key factors for death 

- Severity of suffering involved
    - Awareness of the experience
    - Fear involved (have they seen other organisms die in this way)
    - Physical suffering
- Time
    - Duration (objective)
    - Relative time (subjective)

    —> Depends upon how animals perceive time. Probably more relative but need to update this. Perhaps could combine both 

How is welfare assessed?

Direct indicators of poor welfare;

Tests of avoidance;

Tests of positive preference;

Measures of ability to carry out normal
behaviour and other biological functions; 

Direct indicators of good behaviour
(Broom 2007).

Physiological and behavioural
indicators of pleasure;

Extent to which strongly preferred
behaviours can be shown;

Variety of normal behaviours shown
or suppressed;

Extent to which normal physiological
processes and anatomical development
are possible;

Extent of behavioural aversion shown;
Physiological and behavioural attempts
to cope;

Immunosuppression;

Disease and body damage prevalence;

Behaviour pathology;

Brain changes;

Body damage prevalence;

Reduced ability to grow or breed; 

Reduced life expectancy
